# Superformula Coding Challenge

## Getting Started üèÉ

Create an `.env` file and copy the contents of `.env.example`, insert your own Yelp API key

### `npm install && npm start`

### [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## Instructions üìö

See [requirements](/.requirements/README.md) and [designs](https://www.figma.com/file/4MqQhKPsnKetTud9tm6kDY/Superformula-FE-test-264388d?node-id=0%3A1)

## Tech Stack ü§ñ

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/)
-   [Next](https://nextjs.org/)
-   [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
-   [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
-   [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

## Tooling üß∞

-   [Codegen](https://graphql-code-generator.com/)
-   [CommitLint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/)
-   [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
-   [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
-   [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
-   [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

## Decisions üí≠

I opted to go against the guidelines in one important way: I decided to use NextJS which may fall within the bounds of "_Do not_ use any React boilerplate, such as Create React App". What this means:

-   The project comes with a bunch of out of the box features, optimizations, etc
-   **I won't be showing:** technical skills related to routing, bundler tooling, bundle optimization, or establishing server side rendering (I can speak to/provide examples of these as needed)
-   **I will be showing:** writing clear, concise, testable and transferable code that is not specific to this or any other React template
-   **Why I chose to do this:** I wanted to deliver quickly while focusing on the core "what you should strive for" skills, NextJS provides an extremely easy to establish API which I used to proxy the Yelp API and is readily deployable to a service like Vercel

I opted to use a local Storybook deployment tool (that can be setup as part of a CI/CD pipeline as well) and Github pages simply down to ease of implementation. In its current state, it requires a developer to run the deployment command, but ideally for a long-standing production application this would be automated to be kept up-to-date

## Scripts üíª

### Build `npm run build`

Creates a production build

### Commit `npm run commit`

Runs linter, interactive Git file selector, and then git-cz for clean, consistently formatted commit messages

### GraphQL `npm run graphql`

Runs both sub GraphQL scripts in parallel

#### GraphQL:Schema `npm run graphql:schema`

Creates a GraphQL schema file based on the connected GraphQL API for use with IDE GraphQL tools that provide intellisense when writing queries

#### GraphQL:Queries `npm run graphql:queries`

Creates a Typescript file with all types on the connected GraphQL API via introspection, as well as queries and hooks generated from within this codebase

### Lint `npm run lint`

Runs the linter on the entire project

### Serve `npm run serve`

Serves a production build (must be built previously)

### Start `npm run start`

Runs the development build and server and watches the codebase for changes

### Storybook `npm run storybook`

Runs Storybook locally

#### Storybook:Build `npm run storybook:build`

Creates a static version of the Storybook build

#### Storybook:Deploy `npm run storybook:deploy`

Pushes a static Storybook build to the `gh-pages` branch on Github which will update the Github Pages site

### Test `npm run test`

Runs the tests within the entire project

#### Test:Coverage `npm run test:coverage`

Runs tests as well as collects test coverage

### Upgrade `npm run upgrade`

Runs an interactive tool to check for new versions of existing dependencies, allowing for selective upgrading
